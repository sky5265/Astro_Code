This is a directory where I will have a series of codes, modules, and 
references that will occasionally be useful to basic Astronomy work.

The file Astro_useful_funcs.py is a long python file that has a series of 
useful functions in Astronomy. These include conversions from flux to luminosity,
calculating distance from luminosity, calculating reddening due to dust, 
and various cosmological distance measures. Many of these functions are from qualifying exams  preparation, but there will 
also be ones that I need independently for research. Maybe this file can be useful for other humans. 

I will also eventually add in various figures and visualizations of astronomy concepts. 
I plan to have at least a visualization of the coordinate systems stuff, when I get around to building that visualization.
