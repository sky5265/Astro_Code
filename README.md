This is a directory where I will have a series of codes, modules, and 
references that will occasionally be useful to Astro stuff. 

There will be figures that are useful, and a .py file called 
useful_functions.py that will contain a long list of functions that will 
be even tangentially useful. Many of these functions are from quals 
preparation, but there will also be ones that I need independently for 
research. Maybe potentially this can be useful for other humans.
